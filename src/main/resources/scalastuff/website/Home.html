              <h2>Welcome to ScalaStuff!</h2>
   
   <p>After hibernating for so many years in Java Enterprise world, software developing
   is on the move again. High scalability rush is happening. Everybody wants to go Cloud.
   Success of Google, Amazon, social network
   web sites inspires many to apply same technologies in other areas, traditionally
   occupied by JEE stack. JVM provides very fast and efficient execution
   platform, Scala gives us immutable data structures, concurrency and parallel execution,
   NoSQL provides fast and scalable data storage.</p>

   <p>What is also needed is a foundation, set of frameworks and libraries which make software development
   using this new paradigms fun. They must take care of low-level details, plumbing, provide
   new concepts to avoid re-inventing same mechanisms for each new project and writing boilerplate
   code again and again.</p>
   
   <p>There is a lot of work to do, we are now in the "green field" situation. A lot of frameworks
   will appear to compete and complement each other. ScalaStuff wants to be part of this process
   and provide development community with quality technologies designed for high performance,
   high scalability, high availability. We do not want to reinvent stuff, there are
   enough areas where nothing is done yet. We want our technologies integrate with existing ones
   to provide the most benefit.</p>
   
   <p>We want to support community and be supported by the community. Feel free to provide your
   ideas, comments, patches, just feedback - it will be all very much appreciated.</p>
