	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	ScalaBeans is a reflection toolkit. It provides run-time discovery mechanism for domain objects written in Scala.
	This can be used to simplify integration with existing reflection-based Java libraries and developing Scala-native
	ones. Type information (including generic type arguments) is preserved. ScalaBeans supports Scala-specific features
	like immutablity, collections, case classes and others.
	</p>
	<p>
	ScalaBeans is also a set of agreements on how Scala language constructs must be interpreted from the reflection point
	of view. It provides answers on such questions as: what is a property? how object can be instantiated at runtime?
	how construct collections at run-time? and many others. 
	</p>
	<p>
	We believe that having all this questions been sorted out and implemented in a fast
	and robust library provides Scala folks with powerful armor for developing amazing new technologies. Areas traditionally
	occupied by reflection are serialization, persistence, GUI frameworks. It is just so much easier to say: "hey, here is my
	object, would you like to save it in the database?" and write one line of code than write boiler-plate code for each and
	every property of your bean. ScalaBeans make it possible.  
	</p>
	<p>
	One word of caution. As OO-programmers with decades of experience we believe in strongly-typed languages and are convinced
	that language compiler is our best friend. We encourage you to use decent design (OOP or FP - whichever you like most) and
	get your code checked by compiler as much as possible. Use reflection where appropriate and use it with care.    
	</p>	
	<p>
	ScalaBeans comes with <a href="http://protostuff.googlecode.com">protostuff</a> integration. 
	This combination provides fastest (known at the moment of writing) serialization
	mechanism for Scala.
