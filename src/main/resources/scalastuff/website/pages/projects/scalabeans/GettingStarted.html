	<h1>Getting Started</h1>
	<p>
	First, add ScalaBeans dependency to your project.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you use SBT, add following lines to your project:	
	<pre class="brush: scala">
		val scalaStuffRepo = "Scala Stuff Repository" at "https://github.com/scalastuff/maven/raw/master"
  		val scalabeans = "org.scalastuff" %% "scalabeans_2.8.1" % "0.1"
	</pre>
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	If you use Maven, add following lines to your pom.xml:
	<pre class="brush: xml">
		<dependencies>
		...
			<dependency>
		  		<groupId>org.scalastuff</groupId>
		  		<artifactId>scalabeans_2.8.1</artifactId>
		  		<version>0.1</version>
			</dependency>
		</dependencies>
		<repositories>
		...
		<repository>
  			<id>scalastuff</id>
  			<url>https://github.com/scalastuff/maven/raw/master</url>  		
  		</repository>
  		</repositories>
	</pre>
	</p>
	
	<p>ScalaBeans is cross-compiled to Scala 2.8.0, 2.8.1, 2.9.0RC1</p>
	
	<p>
	Once dependencies are set up, make simple bean <i>(Note: inner classes are not supported)</i>:
	
	<pre class="brush: scala">
		class Person {
			var firstName = ""
			var lastName = ""
			var dateOfBirth = new java.util.Date(0)
		}
	</pre>
	
	As you can see, we declared all the properties as vars and provided not-null default values. ScalaBeans can work with immutable beans as well,
	you can read about it in <a>Constructors</a> and <a>Building new Bean instances</a>
	chapters. Discussion about nulls comes in <a>Serialization</a> chapter. Let's leave it as it is for now and go on with introspection:
	
	<pre class="brush: scala">
		import org.scalabeans.Preamble._
		
		object ScalaBeansExample extends Application {
			val descriptor = descriptorOf[Person]
			for (property &lt;- descriptor.properties)
				println(property.name + ": " + property.scalaType) 
		}
	</pre>
	
	If you run application above, you will see following output:
	<pre>
		firstName: String
		lastName: String
		dateOfBirth: Date
	</pre> 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	That's it. In simple cases there is not much more than that. Read in next chapters about bean properties, constructors, type information
	and how they can be used in more complex scenarios.  
	</p>
