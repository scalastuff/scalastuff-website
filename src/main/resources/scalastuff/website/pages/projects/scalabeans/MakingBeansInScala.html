	<h1>Making Beans in Scala</h1>
	<p>
	So, what is a Bean in Scala? We need a common ground and understanding on this basic question to be able uniformly
	interpret data structures coded in Scala programming language and not come back to it each time when developing new framework.
	With absence of any form of standard in this area we provide our own answer with ScalaBeans and hope you find it both consistent and usable
	for your applications. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Properties</h2>
	<p>
	Scala val and var class members are recognized as properties. Scala getter+setter combination is recognized as property. No-arg function
	with not Unit return type is <b>not</b> a property. Property immutability is preserved. Consider following class definition:
	<pre class="brush: scala">
	class MyBean {
		val property1 = "value"
		var property2 = "other value"
		def property3 = ...
		def property3_= {
			...
		}
		
		def createChildBean = { 
			... 
		}
	}
	</pre>
	
	In this class <code>property1</code>, <code>property2</code>, <code>property3</code> will be recognized as a property, 
	while <code>createChildBean</code> will not. <code>property1</code> will be recognized as immutable property, of course.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Constructors</h2>
	Only default constructor is recognized and supported for bean instance creation. It may have parameters - big difference with JavaBeans.
	In this way we can work with immutable data structures in ScalaBeans. Each constructor parameter though must match with certain bean property,
	otherwise we will be simply unable to extract enough information from the bean instance to create it again. Consider following example:
	
	<pre class="brush: scala">
	class MyData(x: String) {
		val property1 = x + "value"
	}
	</pre>
	
	While <code>property1</code> is a property, we cannot guess <code>x</code> value at runtime to be able to instantiate a bean. So, we
	can only read the property value, but not create new instance. Better way to define our class is as this:
	
	<pre class="brush: scala">
	class MyData(val x: String) {
		val property1 = x + "value"
	}
	</pre>
	
	or even
	
	<pre class="brush: scala">
	class MyData(val x: String) {
		def property1 = x + "value"
	}
	</pre>
	
	<p>
	ScalaBeans discovers also default constructor parameter values and they can be omitted when creating new bean instance. So, following code
	will work:
	<pre class="brush: scala">
	class MyBean(var property1: String = "some default value")
	
	val descriptor = descriptorOf[MyBean]
	val myBean = descriptor.newInstance()
	</pre>
	
	This will create new bean instance with <code>property1 = "some default value"</code>. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Inheritance is the special case. If superclass has constructor parameters, we have to include them in the subclass as well and not declare
	them as val or var. This is not a problem for ScalaBeans since it uses constructor parameter name to find corresponding property (thanks
	to paranamer library). It is a problem for the bean developer since access to the superclass property will be masked.
	In such situations '_' can be put in front of the constructor parameter name:
	
	<pre class="brush: scala">
	class MySuperBean(var property1: String = "some default value")
	
	class SubclassedBean(_property1: String) extends MySuperBean(_property1) {
		def update(x: String) {
			property1 = "Hello, " + x
		}
	}
	</pre>
	
	ScalaBeans will match <code>_property1</code> to <code>property1</code>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Enums</h2>
	<p>
	Standard Scala enumerations are impossible to work with using reflection. There is also <a href="http://scalastuff.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/scala-enums/">number</a>
	of other problems. We had to introduce another way to code enums. It has to be as elegant as Scala Enumeration class, 
	but in another way: next to some unique	cool features it has to be reflection-friendly. The result is Enum class found in
	ScalaBeans library. We were unlucky with the name choice: both Enum and Enumeration classes are already present in default
	namespace of Scala. So, do not forget to add import when using it.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Here is how it works:
	<pre class="brush: scala">
	import org.scalabeans.Enum
	
	class Color private ()
	object Color extends Enum[Color] {
	  val blue = new Color
	  val red = new Color
	  val yellow = new Color
	}	
	</pre>
	
	All enum values have ordinal and name assigned automatically, but you can redefine them:
	<pre class="brush: scala">
	import org.scalabeans.Enum
	
	case class Color private (r: Int, g: Int, b: Int)
	object Color extends Enum[Color] {
	  val blue = Color(0, 0, 255)
	  val red = Color(255, 0, 0) ordinal 1
	  val yellow = Color(0, 255, 255) name "light-yellow"
	}		
	</pre>
	
	As you can see, custom fields can be added as well. Such enums can be used as bean property types and are easy to work with in the generic way.
	All Enum values of concrete enum type can be obtained at runtime, as well as found by ordinal value or by the name.
