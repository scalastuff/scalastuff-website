	<h1>ScalaBeans</h1>
	<p>ScalaBeans provides run-time discovery and reflection for domain objects written in Scala. 
	Type information (including generic type arguments) is preserved. 
	Scala-specific features like immutability, collections, case classes etc are supported. 
	ScalaBeans provides also high-performance serialization to/from protobuf, json, xml formats using <a href="http://protostuff.googlecode.com">protostuff</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>ScalaBeans is also a set of agreements on how Scala language constructs can be interpreted from the reflection point of view. 
  It provides answers to such questions as: what is a property? how object can be instantiated at runtime? how to construct collections at run-time? and many others. 
  We believe that having all this questions been sorted out and implemented in a fast and robust library provides Scala folks with powerful gears for developing amazing new technologies. 
  Areas traditionally occupied by reflection are serialization, persistence, GUI frameworks. 
  It is just so much easier to say: "hey, here is my object, would you like to save it in the database?" and write one line of code than write boiler-plate code for each and every property of your bean. 
  ScalaBeans make it possible.
  </p>

  <p>One word of caution. 
  We believe in strongly-typed languages and are convinced that language compiler is our best friend. 
  We encourage you to use decent design (OOP or FP - whichever you like most) and get your code checked by compiler as much as possible. 
  Use reflection where appropriate and use it with care.
