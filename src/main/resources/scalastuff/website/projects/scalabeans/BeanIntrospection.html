	<h1>Bean Introspection</h1>
	<p>
	There are 2 types of objects describing a bean within ScalaBeans toolkit: BeanDescriptor and PropertyDescriptor. 
	BeanDescriptor provides access to property descriptors and to bean constructor. It can be obtained in this way:
<pre class="brush: scala">
	import org.scalabeans.Preamble._
	
	val descriptor = descriptorOf[MyBean]
</pre>	
	</p>
	
	<h2>Bean Properties</h2>
	
	<p>
	As we have seen before, there are different kinds of properties: mutable, immutable, constructor parameters.
	In ScalaBeans we have PropertyDescriptor superclass that provides functionality common to all kinds of properties
	and mixin traits ImmutablePropertyDescriptor, MutablePropertyDescriptor, ConstructorParameter which provide
	behavior and information specific to corresponding kinds of properties. ImmutablePropertyDescriptor
	and MutablePropertyDescriptor are mutually exclusive and cannot appear in the same PropertyDescriptor instance.
	ConstructorParameter trait can be added to any of the property descriptor. So, we get only 4 possible combinations:
	<ul>
		<li>ImmutablePropertyDescriptor</li>
		<li>ImmutablePropertyDescriptor with ConstructorParameter</li>
		<li>MutablePropertyDescriptor</li>
		<li>MutablePropertyDescriptor with ConstructorParameter</li>
	</ul>  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This design makes it easy to pattern-match property descriptors and provide different behavior for different kind of properties:
<pre class="brush: scala">
  for (property &lt;- descriptor.property) property match {
  	case constructorParameter: ConstructorParameter => 
  	  println("Constructor parameter " + property.name)
  	case mutable: MutablePropertyDescriptor => 
  	  println("var " + property.name)
  	case immutable: ImmutablePropertyDescriptor => 
  	  println("val " + property.name)
  }
  
  // let's get only mutable properties now
  val mutableProperties = descriptor.properties collect { 
   case mutable: MutablePropertyDescriptor => mutable 
  }
</pre>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Property descriptor encapsulates property type information, it's name and accessors (<code>get</code> for immutable
	and <code>get</code> + <code>set</code> for mutable one).
	</p>
	
	<h2>Type Information</h2>
	<p>
	There are 2 forms of type information available at runtime to Scala programs. Java reflection works with implementations
	of <code>java.lang.reflect.Type</code> interface. Probably the best known one is <code>java.lang.Class</code>, but there
	are others. Scala itself has <code>scala.reflect.Manifest</code> - it can be injected by compiler via implicits mechanism.
	Our first idea was to use Manifest everywhere, but then we saw that it is not suitable for pattern-matching and decided
	to introduce ScalaType which can be constructed at runtime from Manifest or Java Type. Both constructors are available
	in Preamble and both BeanDescriptor and PropertyDescriptor provide type information in form of ScalaType instance. 
	</p>
	<p>
	ScalaType encapsulates type erasure and type arguments (if there are any):
<pre class="brush: scala">
	trait ScalaType {
	  def erasure: Class[_]
	  def arguments: Seq[ScalaType]
	}	
</pre>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Pattern matching</h2>
	
	<p>
	Consider following example:
<pre class="brush: scala">
	def describe(t : ScalaType) = t match {
	  case StringType => "string"
	  case OptionType(StringType) => "option of string"
	  case OptionType(_) => "option of something else"
	  case ListType(OptionType(IntType)) => "sequence of optional ints"
	  case SeqType(OptionType(IntType)) => "sequence (but not a list) of optional ints"
	  case SeqType(OptionType(u)) => "sequence of optional " + u.erasure.getName
	  case i@IterableType(_) => "iterable of things. Concrete type: " + i.erasure.getName
	}
	
	for (property &lt;- descriptor.properties) describe(property.scalaType)	
</pre>
	As you can see, we are able now not only pattern-match on type erasure, but also on type arguments and even extract them
	in the case expressions. It is particularly handy for Option and collection types, when we want to know directly the type
	of collection elements for example.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Collections</h2>
	
	<p>
	ScalaType is useful not only for accessing type information, for collection types it can be also used to get new collection
	builder. It is provided for exact collection type encapsulated by the ScalaType instance and not for the one which was
	pattern-matched. So, you can safely match on CollectionType and ask for new builder from it, it will be of the right type.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	There is some magic happening in CollectionType to find collection companion object and extract newBuilder function from it.
	It is not guaranteed to work for all collection classes. One obvious exclusion is sorted collections - the way they are
	sorted is not present in the type, we need Ordering instance to construct a builder. If companion object does not
	implement GenericCompanion or MapFactory, new builder function will be not discovered as well. 
	
	Look at the CollectionType.newBuilder declaration:
<pre class="brush: scala">
	trait CollectionType extends ... {
		val newBuilder: Option[() => Builder[Any, Traversable[Any]]] = ...
	}
</pre>
	
	This scary code says that CollectionType might have a function which produces new collection Builder. Collection elements
	from the builder point of view are all of type Any, which is not always true, so be careful with element types. 
	
	Let's put all this theory in practice. Consider following example:
	
<pre class="brush: scala">
  class Person {
  	var addresses: Set[Address]
  }
  
  val descriptor = descriptorOf[Person]
  
  for {
  	// get the Scala type first
  	collectionType &lt;- descriptor.property("addresses") collect { case t @ CollectionType(_) => t }
  	// get new builder function (if present, it is an Option)
  	newBuilder &lt;- traversableType.newBuilder
  } {
  	// call the function to instantiate new collection builder
  	val builder = newBuilder()
  	println(builder.result()) // will print Set()
  } 	
</pre> 
	
	Here we can see how all this stuff is used: property type is pattern matched as CollectionType, function extracted from the Option and then
	called to create new Builder instance. Created collection is of type Set - exactly what is declared in the bean class.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Arrays</h2>
	<p>
	Array types can be pattern matched with ArrayType(componentType). Since arrays can be always built, newBuidlder() has ArrayBuilder[Any] type:

<pre class="brush: scala">
	scalaType match {
	  case at@ArrayType(componentType) =>
	    val builder: ArrayBuilder[Any] = at.newBuilder()
	    builder += ...
	    builder.result()
	}
</pre>
As with collections, be careful with the objects you put into array. Since we use reflection, compiler doesn't know the right type here, type check is performed at run-time. Use componentType to get the type information of contained objects.
	</p>
	<h2>Enum types</h2>
	<p>
	Enum types can be pattern matched with <code>EnumType(enum)</code>. The <code>enum</code> object provides access to enum values. Among others it has <code>values</code>, <code>valueOf(name: String)</code>, <code>valueOf(ordinal: Int)</code> :

<pre class="brush: scala">
scalaType match {
  case EnumType(enum) =>
    println(enum.values)
    println(enum.names)
    println(enum.ordinals)
    println(enum.valueOf("red"))
    println(enum.valueOf(1))
}
</pre>

Only ScalaBeans enums are supported. Read <a href="beans-in-scala#Enums">here</a> how to use them.
